# Harvard Manage Mentor - Project Management

## Understand Project Management

- A **project** is: a set of interrelated activities, usually involving a group of people who are working together toward a common goal over a period of time.
- **Project Management** is: planning, scheduling and orchestrating of project activities to achieve objectives within a specified period of time

### Four-Phase Process

- **Planning**
  - Determine the real problem
  - Identify stakeholders
  - Define project objectives
- **Buildup**
  - Assemble project team
  - Develop overall plan
- **Implementation**
  - Monitor and control process
  - Report progress
- **Phaseout**
  - Bring project to closure
  - Identify next steps

### Essential activities carried out during the project management process include
  
- Defining the project scope and objectives
- Developing a schedule
- Creating a budget
- Assembling a project team
- Monitoring the project's progress
- Communicating with stakeholders
- Managing reik to the project

**NOTE**: Returning to an earlier phase doesn't mean you're moving backward or losing ground. It simply means you're incorporating new knowledge and information into the overall project plan.

### Run a Disciplined Innovation Experiment

- List your unknowns
- Rate each unknown for uncertainty and importance
- List the highest-rated unknowns
- Test the unknowns with the highest scores first

## Establish Project Scope

### Define the problem

- Make sure you are defining the problem not the symptoms of the problem

### Identify Stakeholders

- A **project stakeholder** is anyone who has a vested interest in the outcome of your project
- Identify and ask them what success looks like
- **Project Sponsor** - the individual who has autorized the project
- **Contributors, customers, managers and financial staff** - the people who will judge the success or failure of your project
- **Anyone affected by the project's activities or outcomes** - including individuals who may have to do their work differently because of the project
- **People who contribute resources to the project** - such as space, staff members, time, tools, equipment and money

### Define Objectives

### Anticipate Trade-Offs

#### Competing Demands

- **Quality** - satisfactionof the project's requirements
- **Time** - amount of time needed to produce the project's deliverables
- **Cost** - how much money, people, and other resources needed to complete the project.

**_Changing any one of the competing demand variables will change the other two as well._**

#### Communication Tactics

- Keep all stakeholders informed of any changes in your project's objectives
- Find out which of the 3 variables matters most to each stakeholder
- Explain the consequences of any changes in terms of quality, time and cost
- Ask stakeholders to clarify what they're willing to give up inf they want you to do something that will affect the project's quality, time or cost

#### Scope Creep

**_Guard Against Scope Creep: Resist the URge to Solve Everyone's Problems_**

##### How to Manage Scope Creep

- Get agreement on scope before you launch 
- Choose a technique to manage scope creep
  - Make a list of what is in scope
  - Set scope tolerance parameters
- Get Stakeholders to sign off or review parameters

### Estimate Project Resources

#### Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

To create a WBS, follow these steps:

- Ask, "What tasks have to be done to accomplish activity X?"
- Continue to ask this question, breaking tasks into the smallest possible subtasks. Keep going until your answer represents a task that can’t be subdivided further.
- Estimate how long it will take to complete each subtask.
- Estimate how much each subtask will cost in terms of dollars and person-hours.
- Consider the skills you’ll need to perform each subtask.

### Create a Project Charter

#### Why you need it

A **project charter** spells out the nature and scope of the work and management's expectations for results. A formal charter can help ensure that your project doesn’t head off in a direction that jeopardizes organizational objectives. It can also protect against scope creep.

#### What's in it

An effective project charter is a concise written document containing some or all of the following:

- Project mission statement
- Outline of the roles and responsibilities that people will play
- Project sponsor’s name 
- Project scope and objectives
- Relationship between the project's goals and higher organizational goals
- Expected time frame of the work and milestones
- Resources available to the project team
- Constraints
- Assumptions about the project
- Quality requirements
- Major risks

Once you've developed a project charter, you’ll distribute it to all stakeholders. You’ll also distribute it to project team members once you’ve assembled your team.

## Develop a Schedule and Budget

- Determine the _latest_ date for completing your project and work backward

### Steps for drafting your project schedule

1. Use the Work Breakdown Structure or a similar outline to develop a list of specific activities or tasks.
2. Assign a deliverable to each activity—for instance, "rough draft of survey questions" or "prototype for test market" or "beta version."
3. Use deliverables as a basis for creating a project schedule with realistic milestones and due dates.
4. Identify bottlenecks that could upset the schedule.
5. Determine ways to remove bottlenecks or build in extra time to get around them.
6. Establish control and communication systems for updating and revising the schedule.

### Optimize your schedule

Critically examine your draft schedule. Seek ways to make it more accurate, more realistic, and tighter. Look for:

- **Errors**. Are your time estimates realistic? Pay particular attention to time estimates for tasks on the critical path. If any of these tasks cannot be completed on time, the entire schedule will unravel. Also, review the relationships between tasks. Does your schedule reflect tasks that can start simultaneously and those that can’t start until some other task is completed?
- **Oversights**. Have you left out any tasks or subtasks? Have you overlooked time for training and maintenance?
- **Overcommitments**. Will some employees have to work 10 to 12 hours per day for months on end to complete the tasks assigned to them? Are you expecting a piece of equipment to perform in excess of its known capacity? If so, remove such overcommitments—for instance, by redistributing the workload.
- **Bottlenecks**. Will work necessary for a particular task pile up at that point in the process? Think of an auto assembly line that has to stop periodically because the people who install the seats cannot keep up with the pace of the line. To remove bottlenecks, speed up the work process used in that task or shift resources into that task—for example, by adding people who have some slack time in their responsibilities.

### Scheduling systems

Managers use several different kinds of tools to create draft schedules. These include **bar charts** (GANT), **flow charts** (critical path diagram), and **PERT** (Performance Evaluation and Review Technique) charts.

### Create a Budget

A **budget** is the financial blueprint or action plan for your project. It translates the project plan into measurable expenditures and anticipated returns over a certain period of time. Your success as a project manager, as well as the success of your project itself, will be measured in part on whether you complete the project within the budget.

Creating your budget is something you do during the buildup phase of the project management process. However, you may have to adjust your budget during the implementation phase if circumstances change.

To develop your project budget, first ask yourself: What is it going to take—in terms of resources—to successfully complete this project? To determine the cost of the project, break it down into the key cost categories you anticipate.

#### Typical project costs

Identify the cost categories, also known as line items, relevant for your budget. Typical project cost categories include:

- Personnel. This is almost always the largest part of a project's budget. It includes full-time and temporary workers.
- Travel. People may have to travel from one location to another to do their project work. Consider whether everyone will be on-site, or whether the team will need to gather at one locale. Remember to budget for meals and lodging.
- Training. If training will be required, determine whether it will take place on-site, or whether travel expenses will be involved. If you plan to hire an outside contractor to provide the training, make sure your budget reflects his or her fees and expenses.
- Supplies. In addition to the usual—computers, pens, papers, software—you may need unique materials.
- Space. If some people may have to be relocated to other facilities, estimate how much room and money that would require.
- Research. Consider whether you’ll have to buy studies or data to support your project versus your team performing such research itself.
- Professional services. If you’ll have to hire a market research firm, bring in a consultant, or seek legal advice, reflect those costs in your budget.
- Capital expenditures. You may need equipment or technical upgrades to complete the project. Some of these capital expenditures will need to pay for themselves.

#### Should your project proceed?

To build your project budget, you estimate costs before the work actually begins. So creating the budget gives everyone a chance to consider whether they really want to move ahead, given the costs.

## Assemble Your Project Team

### Understand Your Role

#### Project Manager

If you’re the project manager, you plan and schedule project tasks and oversee day-to-day project execution. You have has the greatest accountability for the endeavor's success. You receive authority from the sponsor and play a central role in each project phase.

In many respects, your tasks resemble those of any manager leading a team. You:

- Identify needed resources
- Recruit effective participants
- Coordinate activities
- Negotiate with higher-level management, especially the sponsor
- Mediate conflicts
- Set milestones
- Manage the budget
- Keep work on track, so project deliverables are provided on time and on budget

As a project manager, you may not have formal authority over all the people participating in the project work. You need to draw on your leadership skills to influence such team members' behavior and performance.

#### Project team leader

If you’re a project team leader, you may report directly to the project manager and take responsibility for one or more aspects of the work. If your project is small, you might serve as both the project manager and the project team leader.

As project team leader, you:

- Regularly communicate progress and problems to the project manager
- Periodically assess team progress and team members’ outlook
- Make sure that everyone contributes and that everyone's voice is heard

You also play six roles:

- **Initiator** — identify actions needed to meet project goals and encourage team members to take those actions
- **Model** — demonstrate behavior that supports the project's success, such as meeting with customers or re-testing a new database’s functionality
- **Negotiator** — use negotiating skills to obtain resources needed for the project and to work with other project teams
- **Listener** — gather signals from the environment—about impending trouble on the project, team member discontent, or emerging opportunities—and make decisions informed by what you’re hearing
- **Coach** — use coaching to help team members excel
- **Working member of the team** — do a share of the work, particularly in areas where you have special competence
