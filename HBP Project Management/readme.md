# Harvard Manage Mentor - Project Management

## Understand Project Management

- A **project** is: a set of interrelated activities, usually involving a group of people who are working together toward a common goal over a period of time.
- **Project Management** is: planning, scheduling and orchestrating of project activities to achieve objectives within a specified period of time

### Four-Phase Process

- **Planning**
  - Determine the real problem
  - Identify stakeholders
  - Define project objectives
- **Buildup**
  - Assemble project team
  - Develop overall plan
- **Implementation**
  - Monitor and control process
  - Report progress
- **Phaseout**
  - Bring project to closure
  - Identify next steps

### Essential activities carried out during the project management process include
  
- Defining the project scope and objectives
- Developing a schedule
- Creating a budget
- Assembling a project team
- Monitoring the project's progress
- Communicating with stakeholders
- Managing reik to the project

**NOTE**: Returning to an earlier phase doesn't mean you're moving backward or losing ground. It simply means you're incorporating new knowledge and information into the overall project plan.

- List your unknowns
- Rate each unknown for uncertainty and importance
- List the highest-rated unknowns
- Test the unknowns with the highest scores first

## Establish Project Scope

### Define the problem

- Make sure you are defining the problem not the symptoms of the problem

### Identify Stakeholders

- A **project stakeholder** is anyone who has a vested interest in the outcome of your project
- Identify and ask them what success looks like
- **Project Sponsor** - the individual who has autorized the project
- **Contributors, customers, managers and financial staff** - the people who will judge the success or failure of your project
- **Anyone affected by the project's activities or outcomes** - including individuals who may have to do their work differently because of the project
- **People who contribute resources to the project** - such as space, staff members, time, tools, equipment and money

### Define Objectives

### Anticipate Trade-Offs

#### Competing Demands

- **Quality** - satisfactionof the project's requirements
- **Time** - amount of time needed to produce the project's deliverables
- **Cost** - how much money, people, and other resources needed to complete the project.

**_Changing any one of the competing demand variables will change the other two as well._**

#### Communication Tactics

- Keep all stakeholders informed of any changes in your project's objectives
- Find out which of the 3 variables matters most to each stakeholder
- Explain the consequences of any changes in terms of quality, time and cost
- Ask stakeholders to clarify what they're willing to give up inf they want you to do something that will affect the project's quality, time or cost

#### Scope Creep

**_Guard Against Scope Creep: Resist the URge to Solve Everyone's Problems_**

##### How to Manage Scope Creep

- Get agreement on scope before you launch 
- Choose a technique to manage scope creep
  - Make a list of what is in scope
  - Set scope tolerance parameters
- Get Stakeholders to sign off or review parameters

### Estimate Project Resources

#### Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

![Work Breakdown Structure](WBS.jpg)

To create a WBS, follow these steps:

- Ask, "What tasks have to be done to accomplish activity X?"
- Continue to ask this question, breaking tasks into the smallest possible subtasks. Keep going until your answer represents a task that can’t be subdivided further.
- Estimate how long it will take to complete each subtask.
- Estimate how much each subtask will cost in terms of dollars and person-hours.
- Consider the skills you’ll need to perform each subtask.

### Create a Project Charter

#### Why you need it

A **project charter** spells out the nature and scope of the work and management's expectations for results. A formal charter can help ensure that your project doesn’t head off in a direction that jeopardizes organizational objectives. It can also protect against scope creep.

#### What's in it

An effective project charter is a concise written document containing some or all of the following:

- Project mission statement
- Outline of the roles and responsibilities that people will play
- Project sponsor’s name 
- Project scope and objectives
- Relationship between the project's goals and higher organizational goals
- Expected time frame of the work and milestones
- Resources available to the project team
- Constraints
- Assumptions about the project
- Quality requirements
- Major risks

Once you've developed a project charter, you’ll distribute it to all stakeholders. You’ll also distribute it to project team members once you’ve assembled your team.

## Develop a Schedule and Budget

- Determine the _latest_ date for completing your project and work backward

### Steps for drafting your project schedule

1. Use the Work Breakdown Structure or a similar outline to develop a list of specific activities or tasks.
2. Assign a deliverable to each activity—for instance, "rough draft of survey questions" or "prototype for test market" or "beta version."
3. Use deliverables as a basis for creating a project schedule with realistic milestones and due dates.
4. Identify bottlenecks that could upset the schedule.
5. Determine ways to remove bottlenecks or build in extra time to get around them.
6. Establish control and communication systems for updating and revising the schedule.

### Optimize your schedule

Critically examine your draft schedule. Seek ways to make it more accurate, more realistic, and tighter. Look for:

- **Errors**. Are your time estimates realistic? Pay particular attention to time estimates for tasks on the critical path. If any of these tasks cannot be completed on time, the entire schedule will unravel. Also, review the relationships between tasks. Does your schedule reflect tasks that can start simultaneously and those that can’t start until some other task is completed?
- **Oversights**. Have you left out any tasks or subtasks? Have you overlooked time for training and maintenance?
- **Overcommitments**. Will some employees have to work 10 to 12 hours per day for months on end to complete the tasks assigned to them? Are you expecting a piece of equipment to perform in excess of its known capacity? If so, remove such overcommitments—for instance, by redistributing the workload.
- **Bottlenecks**. Will work necessary for a particular task pile up at that point in the process? Think of an auto assembly line that has to stop periodically because the people who install the seats cannot keep up with the pace of the line. To remove bottlenecks, speed up the work process used in that task or shift resources into that task—for example, by adding people who have some slack time in their responsibilities.

### Scheduling systems

Managers use several different kinds of tools to create draft schedules. These include **bar charts** (GANT), **flow charts** (critical path diagram), and **PERT** (Performance Evaluation and Review Technique) charts.

### Create a Budget

A **budget** is the financial blueprint or action plan for your project. It translates the project plan into measurable expenditures and anticipated returns over a certain period of time. Your success as a project manager, as well as the success of your project itself, will be measured in part on whether you complete the project within the budget.

Creating your budget is something you do during the buildup phase of the project management process. However, you may have to adjust your budget during the implementation phase if circumstances change.

To develop your project budget, first ask yourself: What is it going to take—in terms of resources—to successfully complete this project? To determine the cost of the project, break it down into the key cost categories you anticipate.

#### Typical project costs

Identify the cost categories, also known as line items, relevant for your budget. Typical project cost categories include:

- Personnel. This is almost always the largest part of a project's budget. It includes full-time and temporary workers.
- Travel. People may have to travel from one location to another to do their project work. Consider whether everyone will be on-site, or whether the team will need to gather at one locale. Remember to budget for meals and lodging.
- Training. If training will be required, determine whether it will take place on-site, or whether travel expenses will be involved. If you plan to hire an outside contractor to provide the training, make sure your budget reflects his or her fees and expenses.
- Supplies. In addition to the usual—computers, pens, papers, software—you may need unique materials.
- Space. If some people may have to be relocated to other facilities, estimate how much room and money that would require.
- Research. Consider whether you’ll have to buy studies or data to support your project versus your team performing such research itself.
- Professional services. If you’ll have to hire a market research firm, bring in a consultant, or seek legal advice, reflect those costs in your budget.
- Capital expenditures. You may need equipment or technical upgrades to complete the project. Some of these capital expenditures will need to pay for themselves.

#### Should your project proceed?

To build your project budget, you estimate costs before the work actually begins. So creating the budget gives everyone a chance to consider whether they really want to move ahead, given the costs.

## Assemble Your Project Team

### Understand Your Role

#### Project Manager

If you’re the project manager, you plan and schedule project tasks and oversee day-to-day project execution. You have has the greatest accountability for the endeavor's success. You receive authority from the sponsor and play a central role in each project phase.

In many respects, your tasks resemble those of any manager leading a team. You:

- Identify needed resources
- Recruit effective participants
- Coordinate activities
- Negotiate with higher-level management, especially the sponsor
- Mediate conflicts
- Set milestones
- Manage the budget
- Keep work on track, so project deliverables are provided on time and on budget

As a project manager, you may not have formal authority over all the people participating in the project work. You need to draw on your leadership skills to influence such team members' behavior and performance.

#### Project team leader

If you’re a project team leader, you may report directly to the project manager and take responsibility for one or more aspects of the work. If your project is small, you might serve as both the project manager and the project team leader.

As project team leader, you:

- Regularly communicate progress and problems to the project manager
- Periodically assess team progress and team members’ outlook
- Make sure that everyone contributes and that everyone's voice is heard

You also play six roles:

- **Initiator** — identify actions needed to meet project goals and encourage team members to take those actions
- **Model** — demonstrate behavior that supports the project's success, such as meeting with customers or re-testing a new database’s functionality
- **Negotiator** — use negotiating skills to obtain resources needed for the project and to work with other project teams
- **Listener** — gather signals from the environment—about impending trouble on the project, team member discontent, or emerging opportunities—and make decisions informed by what you’re hearing
- **Coach** — use coaching to help team members excel
- **Working member of the team** — do a share of the work, particularly in areas where you have special competence

## Manage Project Risks

_Risk management consists of three steps:_

1. Conduct a risk audit.
2. Take action to avoid or minimize risks you’ve identified.
3. Develop contingency plans.

### Conduct a risk audit

To conduct a risk audit, take stock of all the things that could go wrong with your project:

- **Collect ideas widely**. People's perspectives about risk differ greatly. Some foresee perils that others miss entirely. So talk with project team members, customers, or suppliers to get a complete picture of risks to your project.For instance, a supplier tells you that a rival company is working on a product for the same market that your team is working on. Even more worrisome, the competitor's product development team is much further along than yours.
- **Identify internal risks**. Understaffing is a common source of risk. One key resignation could cause an important project to collapse. Poorly trained quality assurance personnel represent another source of internal risk. Their substandard work may allow defective or dangerous products to reach customers. That could result in a costly product recall, lawsuits, and a public relations fiasco.
- **Identify external risks**. An external risk may take the form of an emerging technology that will render your new product line obsolete. An impending regulatory change may also pose a threat.

Pay particular attention to problems that have the _greatest potential to harm your project_. Depending on the project, these might include health and environmental issues, technical breakdowns, economic and market volatility, and relationships with customers and suppliers.

Then identify _which of these things are most likely to surface_.

Risks that would do the most harm _**and**_ are the most likely to surface are the ones you most need to avoid or minimize.

### Avoid or Minimize Risk

#### Identify Most Harmful and Most Likely Risks

![Risk Identification](Risks.jpg)

Look at the risks that represent the worst things that could go wrong for your project and that are most likely to occur. For any such risks that you’re not prepared to confront, alter your project's scope to avoid them.

With other risks, you may take steps to prevent them from escalating into full-blown crises.

### Develop Contingency Plans

Develop contingency plans for unavoidable and uncontrollable risks. A **contingency plan** is a course of action you prepare in advance to deal with a potential problem. It answers this question: "If _____ happens, how could we respond in a way that would neutralize or minimize the damage?"

A good contingency plan prepares your project and organization to deal quickly and effectively with adverse situations. When disaster strikes, you and your project team can take immediate action. You don't have to spend weeks trying to figure out what you should do or how you’ll find the resources to deal with the situation.

Every project has risk.  Ask, "Where is my risk?"  Sometimes the risk will be **technical**, **budget**, **schedule**, etc...

## Monitor Project Progress and Problems

### Understand Project Monitoring

Project monitoring happens during the implementation phase of the project management process. As you monitor your project, you assess progress toward the project’s objectives and address any challenges that come up. These could include problems within your project team or difficulties with schedule, budget, or quality of your project’s outcomes.

### Manage Your Team

If you're managing a sizable project with plenty of meetings and many participants, systematically keep track of decisions, assignments, and action items. Many organizations use **meeting minutes** — notes recorded by an appointed individual — for this purpose. The minutes are reviewed and approved at the next meeting and amended if necessary. Approved minutes then go into a file, and participants can consult them as needed.

In addition, make the most of **milestones** — significant events in a project—to remind team members of how far they’ve come and how much further they must go. Examples of milestones include:

- The successful testing of a product prototype
- Installation and successful testing of a critical piece of equipment
- Delivery of finished components to the stockroom
- Completion of the project—the ultimate milestone

Use milestones as occasions for celebrating progress; for instance, with a group luncheon or an outing.

### Address Team Challenges

As your project’s implementation proceeds, identify any team challenges that affect productivity and move swiftly to resolve them

### Monitor Budget

Compare the actual spending for a given period during your project implementation with the spending specified in your budget. If actual spending is higher than what you budgeted, identify the cause. Then take corrective action.

Factors that can send your project over budget include:

- Failure to factor in currency exchange rates or exchange-rate fluctuations
- Unexpected inflation during long-term projects
- Lack of firm prices from suppliers and subcontractors
- Estimates based on different costing methods, such as hours versus dollars
- Unplanned personnel costs incurred to keep the project on schedule, including increased overtime
- Unexpected space or training needs
- Consultant or legal fees needed to resolve unforeseen problems

### Monitor Schedule

Highlight milestones in your project schedule and use them to monitor progress. Track the following aspects of your project schedule:

- **Hours**. How much work has been expended on any given activity? Does the number of hours expended match the number specified in your budget? If not, why not?
- **Activities**. Which activities have been worked on? When did they start? Are they complete? Were they finished on schedule? If not, why not?
- **Milestones**. Have milestones been met? If so, which ones? If not, why not?
- **Deliverables**. Have deliverables been completed on time? Did they meet quality standards? What caused any shortfalls?

Delays can be caused by vague project objectives or an overly optimistic -schedule. Scheduling problems can also result from an incomplete project plan, failure to manage risks, or lack of proper tracking and control.

If your project experiences scheduling problems, find out what’s causing them. Then take corrective measures. That might mean asking for additional resources, putting the schedule on an accelerated course, or persuading the project sponsor to accept the delay.

### Monitor Scope

Watch for signs of “scope creep”—stakeholders asking you to address more and more problems throughout implementation of your project. Revisit the scope you originally defined for your project.

If stakeholders insist that the project accomplish more than its original intent, discuss the potential impact on project time, cost, and quality of outcomes. Clearly point out any trade-offs that must be made.

### Monitor Quality

To check quality during your project’s implementation, examine some unit of work at an appropriate point to ensure that it meets specifications. Inspect deliverables using the most appropriate tools, such as detailed inspections, checklists, and statistical sampling. Depending on costs, determine whether any rejected deliverables can be returned or reworked.

Periodic quality checks uncover conditions that are out of specifications. Once you've identified these problems, your project team can figure out what’s causing them and take action to address them.

## Communication with Stakeholders

### Benefits

Communicating with your project stakeholders—your team members, the project sponsor, and anyone else with an interest in the project—is critical during all four phases of the project management process. Through ongoing communication, you keep stakeholders apprised of how the project is progressing, what problems you’re encountering, and how you’re dealing with those problems. Regular communication also maintains project team commitment and ensures ongoing support from your project sponsor and other stakeholders.

### Launch Meeting

The launch meeting is a key method for communicating with and motivating your project team. The launch meeting ideally is held at the beginning of the implementation phase. You and your project team will have discussed the project extensively and engaged in detailed planning before the launch meeting during the buildup phase. But there’s no substitute for a face-to-face gathering attended by all team members. Be sure to include the project sponsor.

Physical presence at this meeting has great psychological value. This is particularly true for geographically dispersed teams, whose members have few opportunities to convene as a group. Being together at the very beginning builds commitment. It also bolsters each participant's sense that the team and project are important.

During your project launch meeting:

- Define roles and responsibilities.
- Review the project charter.
- Seek unanimous understanding of the project charter.
- Have the project sponsor explain why the project's work is important and how its goals are aligned with the larger organizational objectives.
- Outline the resources that will be available to the team.
- Describe team incentives.

### Team Meetings

Meetings are often the best way to communicate information throughout all phases of a project. During meetings, project team members can share ideas and make decisions. To make the most of meetings, stick to a regular schedule as much as possible. If people know that project team meetings take place every Monday from 3 to 4 p.m., they can plan their other responsibilities around those times. Having a regular schedule also saves meeting organizers the frustrating task of finding a time when everyone is available.

### Progress Reports

To manage your project team, create progress reports that track all the work that's being done on your project. File progress reports in an orderly way that makes them accessible to whoever needs the information.

### Regular Updates

Project stakeholders want continuous updates, status reports, and progress reports. So establish a plan to regularly communicate with your project’s key stakeholders. For instance, hold a monthly meeting supplemented with weekly status reports.

When you meet with stakeholders:

- Identify project goals.
- Alert stakeholders of changes in the project's objectives and the consequences of those changes in terms of quality, time, and costs—then verify that they accept responsibility for those consequences.
- Clarify assumptions about projected costs and completion dates.
- Get feedback on the project management process after the project is completed.

In communicating about the project with stakeholders, don’t downplay or hide problems that have come up. If you do this and the problems sabotage the project in your stakeholders' eyes, you'll be in more trouble than if you had alerted stakeholders in the first place.

## Close Out a Project

### Post-Project Evaluation

Determine how well your project performed relative to quality, schedule, and cost:

- **Quality**. Have all objectives been met? Have project deliverables met the mandated specifications?
- **Schedule**. Was the project completed on time? If not, determine the cause of the delay. Identify how it could have been prevented.
- **Cost**. Did the total cost of completing the project come within budget constraints? If the project ran over budget, the team should determine the cause of the overspending and identify how it might have been avoided.

To get the most from your project evaluation, use it as an opportunity to learn, not as a time to criticize and blame. If some team members fear that they’ll be punished for past problems, they may make the same mistakes on future projects rather than find better ways of handling them. 

Also, consider bringing in outside facilitators. Project evaluations are best conducted with help from an independent person who can objectively assess the information. Typically, team members have been working so closely together that they’ve lost some perspective on the process. An independent facilitator can sort out the emotional from the practical issues.

### Lessons Learned

Work with your team to identify what went right and what went wrong—and what you all can learn from this analysis. List successes, mistakes, corrected assumptions, and processes that could have been handled better. That list will become part of the project's documented record.

Document all the lessons you and your team have identified, grouped by topic—such as planning, budgeting, and execution. Ensure that the document is available to all subsequent project teams. Next to the project deliverables, these lessons may be the most valuable output of your team's effort.

### Final Report

Create a final report summarizing your findings. A typical post-project evaluation report addresses:

- **Current project status**. What were the original objectives? What has the team achieved?
- **Future status**. What will happen to the project now that it has been completed? Will it be incorporated into an ongoing production process? Was it part of a larger project? Was it a self-contained entity that has achieved its goals?
- **Status of ongoing critical tasks**. What is the current condition of ongoing tasks that contain a high level of technical risk or that are being performed by outside vendors or subcontractors?
- **Risk**. Are there, or were there, any risks that could have a potential for financial loss, project failure, or other liabilities?
- **Information relevant to other projects**. What lessons learned can be applied to other projects under way or being planned? How can these lessons be communicated so they are not "lessons lost"?
- **Limitations of the project evaluation**. Are there any factors that might limit the validity of the evaluation—such as incorrect assumptions or missing information?

### Celebration

To mark the formal end of a project, hold a celebration to acknowledge your team's success. Invite all project team members and the project sponsor. Also consider inviting customers, suppliers, and non-project employees who contributed to the group's results.

Reflect on what the team accomplished and how the project has benefited the company. If the project failed to deliver on its entire list of objectives, highlight the effort that people made and the goals they did achieve.

Thank all who helped and participated. Then celebrate completion of your project.
